Py Space Strategy Boardgame
===========================

I love strategy board games. There’s just one problem - there 
are too many darn pieces to keep track of.

In this project I’ve combined a raspberryPi, a projector, and
a camera to create a strategy 'boardgame' which handles the 
details for you.


ABOUT THE PROJECT
=================

Overview:

  The whole thing (projector, camera, program, keyboard) runs 
  off a raspberry pi 3.

  A projector paints a board for you to play on. You interact
  with the program by placing colour-coded tokens on the 
  board. When you are done your placements, you end your turn.
  A camera then scans the relevant places on the board for
  your tokens. The program will process your move. This
  processing includes: resource collection, combat, upgrade
  purchases, movement. As with any boardgame, there is nothing
  to enforce the rules and prevent you from cheating... that's
  up to you and your opponents.
